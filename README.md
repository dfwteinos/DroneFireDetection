IoT System, based on AI-Agent (UAV) which identifies and search for early wildfires. :fire:


These are the sample files that contains the source code for:

* Drone's Control Pannel.
* Spatial Analysis for the area of interest.
* Mobile Application that gets a push notification triggered when a fire is identified.


Dataset: We obtained images from the FireNET repository (https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/FireNET), in order to train our model.


This project and code is based on *BSc Thesis* for the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (Oct. 2022).

Feel free to contribute with any kind of feedback.
